        Artworks are on paper using watercolor paint, crayons, marker and some other materials and are mounted on cardboard. She made her own presentation boards to upcycle instead of buying something new.
        She hopes her pictures of birds will help people remember their beauty and importance to the ecosystem. We can help the birds better survive by learning more about them and appreciating their amazingness.</td>

      <td class="about">“Women in Bloom” is a portrait series showcasing a diverse group of women whose faces have been partially obscured by botanicals, celebrating women's mental well-being. Floral bouquets emerging from the women's heads represent the normal variation among our brains— including mental illness—and what mental health looks like for that person.
        April Jakubec is first and foremost a mental health advocate, working on her PhD to promote the human rights of adults with severe mental illness. As a sort of self-therapy to cope with her own mental health diagnoses, April has put her own vision of mental health on canvas— fearlessly glam women adorned with sparkling blooms.
        These colorful acrylic, multi-media paintings are embellished with a splash of glitter and coated in high-gloss resin. The collection also includes painted flower pots and glittering busts, along with decorated mirrors for visitors to catch a glimpse of themselves through the artist's lens.</td>

Unlike his candid street photography, this is a straightforward approach: individuals looking into the camera, telling stories through expression, place and pose.</td>
