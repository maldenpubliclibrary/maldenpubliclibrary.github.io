      <td class="artistName">Jen Moltoni</td>
      <td class="about">Jen is a collage/mixed media artist and painter, she draws inspiration from her numerous trips to beaches throughout New England.  Her process is simple - she paints with acrylics, gouache and watercolor on various weights and types of paper – finding joy in the swirling of colors.  Then, she cuts everything she's painted up, stares at a blank canvas, and decide what the shapes she’s cut will become.  She feels that the empty canvas space is as important as the colored pieces she eventually place unto it.  What results are compositions that are multi-colored and textured, with a touch of whimsy, that feature scenes of nature and the ocean and the spaces in between.</td>

      <td class="about">Addie started this project when she was a third grader because she was concerned about the state of our environment. Beautiful Birds was scheduled to be shown at the Malden Public Library in the spring of 2020, but then Covid happened. Now she’s a fifth grader at Forestdale Elementary, but still loves birds and art. 
        Artworks are on paper using watercolor paint, crayons, marker and some other materials and are mounted on cardboard. She made her own presentation boards to upcycle instead of buying something new.
        She hopes her pictures of birds will help people remember their beauty and importance to the ecosystem. We can help the birds better survive by learning more about them and appreciating their amazingness.</td>
